<p>We've all heard of Encryption, right?  That's hiding a message in plain sight, but processed so that (hopefully) no-one can read it.  We should all be using this all the time.</p>

<p>There is another method to protecting data that you might not have considered.  A technique that pre-dates encryption to the extend that it was in use in Ancient Greece - Steganography.   It's not just for those guys from antiquity, though - we can use it even now to this day to conceil messages where no-one would ever think to look for them.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll be introducing the concept of steganography, where it might be used, why you might do it, and how a C# developer can implement it fairly easily.</p>
