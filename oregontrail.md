    <h2>DOWN THE OREGON TRAIL WITH FUNCTIONAL C#</h2>
    <hr/>
<img src="/Content/img/Oregontrail.png">

<p>In 1971, three students from Minnesota thought they could liven up a history lecture by creating a computer game for the students to play, and after several days of work in HP Time Share BASIC, they came up with what turned out to be a significant milestone in the history of computer games - Oregon Trail.</p>

<p>Oregon Trail is often regarded as one of the first great computer games, as well as being the originator of a franchise that is still running to this day. It was effectively also one of the first instances of both Shareware and a Commercial home release of(depending on the version).</p>

<p>My interest though, isn't just in historical computer games, it's also .NET and Functional Programming. I want to use this as a worked example of one of my passions - Functional Programming in C#! The challenge I've set myself is to redevelop Oregon Trail into C# using the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Near 100% unit test coverage</li>
	<li>No variables can change state once set</li>
	<li>No statements (for, foreach, if, where, etc.) unless there literally is no way of avoiding them</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll also be demonstrating a few of the tricks Functional Programming can offer, like Higher-order functions, functional flows with simple Monads and Tail Recursion. There should also be a bit of retro computing fun, while we're at it.</p>
