    <h2>FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <hr>
		<img src="/Content/img/functional-javascript-large.png">
		
    <p>Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by. With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?</P>

<p>Using just a few JavaScript libraries, such as RamdaJS, developers can implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?</P>

<p>This talk will demonstrate how, using ES6 and a few extra libraries, we can write Functional code that is:</p>

<br/>

<p>More robust</p>
<p>Easier to read</p>
<p>Easier to maintain</p>

<br/>


<p>This talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language.</p>

<p>We might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is!</p>
