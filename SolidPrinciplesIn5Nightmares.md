    <h2>SOLID PRINCIPLES in 5 NIGHTMARES</h2>
    <hr/>
<p>The 5 SOLID principles - popularised by "Uncle" Bob Martin in some of his highly influential books on Object Orientated Software development - are rarely cited directly but they are nevertheless at the heart of a lot of the thinking that goes into modern software development.</p>

<p>These principles have been around in some form or other ever since the 1980s, but continue to be just as relevant today as they were then.</p>

<p>In this talk, we're going to look at each of the 5 SOLID principles, these being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single Dependency Principle</li>
<li>Open/Close Principle</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
<li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
</ul>

<p>See what he did there with the names?</p>

<p>We'll look at each in turn, with the help of some slightly imaginative examples taken from a popular SF franchise. What are they, what nightmare scenarios can occur if they aren't followed, and how they can subsequently be applied.</p>
